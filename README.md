# ü¶ô BlazeLama

**BlazeLama** is (hopefully) the first user-friendly, lightweight desktop chat client for [Ollama](https://ollama.com), built with **Blazor Server** and **WPF WebView**.
 
---

## üöÄ Overview

BlazeLama provides a simple and responsive UI for chatting with local Ollama models on Windows. Features include:

- üó®Ô∏è Create and delete chats, assign models to each chat
- üîß Automatically launch Ollama when this app starts (if a path is provided in settings)
- üíæ Store chat history and models in local JSON files

It works with any model downloaded via the [Ollama CLI](https://ollama.com/library).

## üì¶ Installation

> **Requirement:** [Download and install Ollama](https://ollama.com) first.

1. Download the latest `.zip` archive from the **Releases** page  
2. Extract it anywhere  
3. Launch `BlazeLamaDesktop.exe`  
4. (Optional) In settings, specify the full path to `ollama.exe` for automatic startup

---

## üî® Usage

After launching, you'll see the **Home menu** and a **"Create new chat"** button. Clicking it will open a dialog where you can define:

| Field          | Description                            |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Chat name**  | Display name for your chat             |
| **Model name** | Model you want to use for this session |

<div>
    <img src="ChatPopup.png" width="512">
</div>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

On the left sidebar, you'll see your chat list and the **Home** button.

> [!WARNING]  
> A chat is saved only after at least one message is sent.


<div>
    <img src="ChatList.png" width="410">
</div>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Messages, model names, and chat titles are stored in the `Data` folder, located next to the executable. Stored as `.json` files.

> [!TIP]  
> If the app fails to load or gets stuck, you can manually delete corrupted data by closing the app and removing all JSON files from the `Data` folder.

&nbsp;

You can delete any chat by clicking the üóë icon next to it.

There is **no limit on the number of chats**. The message length and memory limitations depend on the model you use.
